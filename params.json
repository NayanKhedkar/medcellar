Both a pretty easy to get up and running and once you get that going it's pretty easy from there. \r\n\r\nWe decided to leverage grunt to make it easier to reset your environment and to get up and running in the first place. There are two version of MedCellar a weak super insecure version and a development, only slight insecure version. The Insecure version shows a slew of vulnerabilities while the development version implements some security controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe configuration files are located in the application directory under the ```config``` folder.\r\n\r\nTo deploy the weak version:\r\n\r\n```grunt deployweak```\r\n\r\nTo deploy the development version:\r\n\r\n```sudo grunt deploy```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of vulnerabilities inside of MedCellar, but we've implemented a few purposefully that you'll be able to find including:\r\n\r\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference\r\n- Cross-Site Scripting\r\n- Authorization Bypass\r\n- CSRF\r\n- Header Weaknesses\r\n- Insecure Random Number Generation\r\n- SSL Weaknesses\r\n- Insecure Cookies\r\n- Local Storage\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
